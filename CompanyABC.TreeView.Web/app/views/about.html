        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This ASP.NET MVC web application renders a tree structure to a depth specified by the input.</p>
            <p>
                I've used Visual Studio 2012 along with ASP.NET MVC5 and AngularJs 1.4 (for it's ease of keeping concerns separate by providing an MVVM type pattern) to develop this application. 
            </p>
        <h3>Start playing</h3>
            <p>
            When the application is run (with the default configuration), you can access a tree of depth 2
            by either typing into the internet browser address bar or clicking on the url <a href="{{uiState.sampleTreeViewUrl}}" ng-bind="uiState.sampleTreeViewUrl"></a>.
            </p>
        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
            
                    <p>
                    Please ensure the "Start Action" for the web project (CompanyABC.TreeView.Web) has been set to "Specific Page" with a blank value.
                    </p>
                    <img src="{{uiState.webProjStartActionImagePath}}" />
            
                To ensure the JS tests run, you'll have to install Chutzpah for Visual Studio.
